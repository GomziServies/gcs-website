                                    guide their teams towards exceptional accomplishments. The first rule entails
                                    harnessing
                                    personal power. Effective leaders recognize their strengths, values, and beliefs,

                                    relationships, they inspire loyalty and commitment.</p>
                                <p>Driving progress and advancement is the third strategic rule. Leaders are visionaries
