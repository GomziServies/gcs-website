                                            who expect to owe a certain amount of tax at the end of the year. If you are
                                            self-employed or
                                            receive income that is not subject to withholding, you may need to make
                                            estimated tax
                                            payments to ensure you meet your tax obligations and avoid penalties for
                                            underpayment.

                                        <p>To ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations, it's advisable to consult
                                            with a
                                            qualified tax professional who can provide guidance specific to your
                                            business and
                                            jurisdiction. Keeping accurate records, staying informed about tax law
                                            changes, and
                                            proactively addressing your tax obligations can help you maintain compliance
                                            and minimize
                                            the risk of penalties.</p>
